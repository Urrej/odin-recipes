# odin-recipes

This is my first Odin project. In this, I hope to create a website where I can use the following skills to log some of my favorite recipes:
Basic HTML
    Headers
    Paragraphs
    Strong and em tags
    HTML comments
    Ordered Lists
    Unordered Lists
    Photos
    Hyperlinks
Git commands
    staging
    commits
    commit messages


When I return, at the end of this project, I will list some of the other things I used as well as anything I've learned.
