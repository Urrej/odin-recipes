<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is, by far, my most favorite sausage gravy recipe. I have since
    shared this recipe with my mother and even she says that she'll never
    make biscuits and gravy the old way again. It's so easy and packed with
    flavor. I think what I love most is the little kick you get from the
    hot sausage and added cayenne pepper. If you can't find Jimmy Dean
    Hot Sausage, you can use regular sausage and add some red chili flakes
    and it will taste just the same.
