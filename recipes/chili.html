<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A regional midwestern classic that makes the rest of the country question
    our sanity. This is a recipe for chili with cinnamon rolls! Now, you can
    use any kind of cinnamon roll you'd like. You can make your own from scratch,
    buy some from a bakery, or, what I do, get the canned version ready to bake!
</p>
<p>What makes this strange combination work is the spicy and savoriness from
    the chili combined with the sugary sweentess of the cinnamon roll. Some 
    people choose to have these separately, but I prefer to take a spoonful
    of chili and add a piece of cinnamon roll on top for a delightful flavor
    combination!
