<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I found this recipe when looking for something to use up a bunch of
    frozen ham that I got from my mom. What I like most about this recipe,
    other than how simple it is, is the addition of peas to make a meal
    that feels very homey and <em>satisfying</em> but also feels healthy.
</p>
<p>You can really use any kind of cheese here (swiss, monterey jack,
    gruyere) but what really amps up this recipe is using
    <strong>pepper jack</strong>!
    Seriously, give it a shot.
